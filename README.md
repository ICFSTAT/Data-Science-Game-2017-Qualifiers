# Data-Science-Game-2017-Qualifiers

This is one my best local submissions in private and public leaderboard. My best submission in the leaderboard is an ensemble of models similiar to this one but this model is the best single model in the leaderboard.

My approach was to work mainly with likelihood features but I think the catch is that to calculate the likelihood if my sample is less than 20 in size, I set the value as missing. Also, I worked with features that describe the behaviour of the user in not flow mode. In fact, to train the model I just considered the rows from flow mode, the other rows were to generate more features about the behaviour of the user in not flow mode.
